                            Our expertise in manufacturing jewelry began with our founder, Avo Sarkisian, who was a skilled diamond setter that specialized in pavé designs. His natural talent in jewelry design was apparent at the start of his young apprenticeship. As he branched out from wholesale to retail by opening his own jewelry store in Beverly Hills, his attention to detail and meticulous craftsmanship won the admiration and recognition of his peers, customers and celebrities alike. Over two generations later, Avo’s and Company has evolved into Adiamor, a cutting edge online retail store that delivers manufacturer direct prices to the public.
                            <br><br>
                            Today, Adiamor carries on the family tradition of excellence by bringing you the very best in craftsmanship and quality. We are artisans, expert jewelers, jewelry consultants and GIA trained gemologists who are passionate about what we do. We offer competitive pricing, and quality, hand-crafted jewelry using only the finest diamonds, colored gemstones and raw materials. Our award winning services continue to win the loyalty of customers worldwide.</p>
